# Exercism Solutions

Over the past few weeks, I've been spending some time working through the different tracks I'm interested in on Exercism.io. Overall, it's been a great way to dive deeper into the languages and has provided me with insight from great mentors. As a way to keep track of my progress more publicly, I wanted to bring the solutions I have submitted and am working on to github.

Please feel free to leave any additional feedback as issues.
